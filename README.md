DBMI BMI 707 Project Repository (Team cdek)


We are using CORD-19 academic articles dataset published and distributed by Allen Institute for AI https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge to discover what is known to the scientific community. We aim to train a recurrent neural network on the published abstracts to generate synythetic abstracts that summarize the consensus in the community to answer basic questions on COVID.
